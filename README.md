Process API Wrapper

So many frameworks for crossplatform GUIs and whatnot but I never see one for
process side stuff which I suspect is the reason for cheat engine only supporting
windows, because of this I decided to try making one starting with win32 side of
stuff since that is what cheat engine developers would need to start preparing to
support other systems, while they port to c/c++ I'll continue looking for other
APIs to support in the hopes that the API will adopted as a standard in most linux
based systems as well.
